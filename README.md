## About Bob's BrainBox

This repository contains the frontend website of the Bob's Brainbox application, the backend/server repository is contained within [this repository](https://github.com/ScandiumSG/Boolean-Quizapp-backend).

The project is part of the final project in the Boolean fullstack development course. The goal behind Bob's Brainbox is to develop a fullstack application in 5 days, to then be presented to other groups in the course. It will first be made into a very simple, bare-bones, MVP application, then further developed as time permits.

## How to run

This is a node project, as such it is very easy to both install and run the website locally.

First install required dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

then initalize the project

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starting the application is development mode will make it available through a localhost address, since the project uses Vite the default port is 5173. Navigate your browser of choice and enter the url 
```bash
http://localhost:5173
```

If other Vite projects are currently running, it will increment the port to run on, in that case look at your terminal window and find the port it is attached to.
